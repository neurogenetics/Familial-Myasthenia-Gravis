## Abstract
**Objectives** To approximate the rate of familial myasthenia gravis and the coexistence of other autoimmune disorders in the patients and their families.
**Design** Retrospective cohort study
**Setting** Clinics across North America
**Participants** The study included 1,032 patients diagnosed with acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChR)-positive myasthenia gravis
**Methods** Phenotype information of 1,032 patients diagnosed with acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChR)-positive myasthenia gravis was obtained from clinics at fourteen centers across North America between January 2010 and January 2011. A critical review of the epidemiological literature on the familial rate of myasthenia gravis was also performed. 
**Results** Among 1,032 patients, 58 (5.6%) reported a family history of myasthenia gravis. In comparing the familial and sporadic cohorts, the only feature that was different was the lower age of onset in familial cases. A history of autoimmune diseases was present in 26.6% of patients and in 28.4% of their family members.
**Discussion** The familial rate of myasthenia gravis was higher than would be expected for a sporadic disease. Furthermore, a high proportion of patients had a personal or family history of autoimmune disease. Taken together, these findings suggest a genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis.
